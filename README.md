## 🇲🇿 Weekly Insights & Journey (Diário de Bordo)
I share my reflections here to document the "why" behind the code. While logic is global, the journey is personal.

### Week 0: Scratch
**Insight:** "A lógica não precisa de código complexo para existir e o mundo dos computadores é composto por zeros e uns, num piscar de olhos tudo pode mudar."
* **EN:** "Logic doesn't need complex code to exist and the world of computers its made up of zeros and ones, in a blink of an eye everything can change"
