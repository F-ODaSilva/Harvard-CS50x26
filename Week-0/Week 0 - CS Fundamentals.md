## 1. Welcome & Introduction of AI
### Welcome to CS50x 2026
Harvard's University CS50x is a course introduction to the **computer science** and the art of **programming**, it is for everybody with or without programming experience.
This course teaches you on how to solve problems, both with or without code, with an emphasis on accuracy, design and style. It includes topics such as **computational thinking**, **abstraction**, **algorithms** & **data structures**. More than teaching you how to program in one language it ultimately teaches you on how to program fundamentally and how to teach oneself to new languages, making you think on how computers work, thinking logically and efficiently. 
The course starts with language called ***C***, then transitions to ***Python***, ***SQL***, even concepts such as ***AI****(Artificial Intelligence)* and ***Machine Learning***, all the way to **Flask*** and finishing with ***CSS***, ***HTML*** & ***JavaScript*** to create web & mobile apps. Culminating in a final project of your own and upon finishing all your tasks you receive a world-class renown certificate from Harvard University, helping you getting higher chances to get a job in the field of tech.
### Introduction to AI
***AI*** or so called **Artificial Intelligence** as we all know it has become extremely advanced and a exciting topic not only in computer science but in the world!
Some worry and others take advantage of this technology, it not only can improve our lives and augment productivity, in some cases it lead to several layoffs due to companies investing and betting on this advancements such as the example we saw last year in 2025 (*if you're reading this in 2026*). Thus for it is important to understand not only rely but be the pilot of this new technology, by learning the fundamentals under AI's hood, thus empowering it and open a new horizon of knowledge, opportunities for not only you but to those you serve and the world!
Instead of getting intimidated you will feel assured that you'll not only be an asset but a contributor.
In this course we will touch the surface and ins of ***Machine Learning*** and ***AI***, furthermore after being successful I will dive deep into this field by starting another of Harvard's University courses called [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](!https://harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python)

## VSCode & Code Optimization
Before beginning to learn how to code or getting my hands dirty with any programming language it is important to know where we will be spend most of our time and do all the working later on, in this course and in my career.
A text editor is a program where you type characters itself it doesn't understand what you write it self but if you add to it a compiler (*that is a separate program and we will be using it to write code in C*) it translates the source code you wrote into zeros (**0**) and ones (**1**), when you mix these two together you get an **IDE**(*Integrated Development Environment*) which is the complete toolbox, that include not only the previous tools but a debugging tool all in one window.

It is important to understand that writing code takes space in your computers memory and if it passes that space the program might not run the way you intend to. This is important later on because it will teach you to write code efficiently in a way that saves not only space, time but it is more understandable to the computer in some cases it can be reused and easily maintained.
